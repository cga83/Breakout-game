This code was written in Python. There is a graphic interface which was done using the library tkinter.

The code is divided into four classes:
- the Ball class,
- the Border class,
- the Platform,
- the Brick.

When you begin to play, you have three lives. Each time you lose the ball, you lose a life. Your score increments when you hit a brick.
